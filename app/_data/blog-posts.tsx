            Also speaking, Professor Abiodun Adebayo, representing Covenant
            University, described the bank as a “family bank” long anticipated
            by the university community. He expressed optimism that the new
            branch would replicate the success of its main office and prayed for
            continued wisdom, prosperity, and success.

          <br />
          <p>
            The Honourable Commissioner for Urban and Regional Planning, Town
            Planner Olatunji Odunlami, further emphasized the branch’s potential
            to unlock financial opportunities in Abeokuta and across Ogun State.
            She reassured the community of the bank’s steadfast commitment to
            professionalism, integrity, and sustainable development, stating,
            “Our growth is intertwined with the growth of the communities we
            serve.” The Abeokuta branch is expected to strengthen community
            bonds, stimulate economic activity, and provide robust financial
            support to individuals and small business owners alike
