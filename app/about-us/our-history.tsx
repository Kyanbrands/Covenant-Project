                Covenant Microfinance Bank was incorporated on May 6, 2003, as a
                private limited liability company and commenced operations on
                March 15, 2004, under the name Covenant University Community
                Bank Limited (CUCB Ltd.). In response to regulatory reforms, it
                was converted into a microfinance bank in January 2008, in line
                with the Central Bank of Nigeria&apos;s directive.

                By December 2012, the bank had met the â‚¦100 million capital
                requirement and was licensed to operate as a State Microfinance
                Bank. Continuing its leadership in digital banking, Covenant MFB
                became one of the first MFBs in 2014 to generate 10-digit NUBAN
                account numbers for its customers. That same year, the bank was
                successfully integrated with Nigeria Central Switch (NCS) and
                gained access to the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) service,
                InterSwitch ATM Network, PayDirect, and QuickTeller platforms.
