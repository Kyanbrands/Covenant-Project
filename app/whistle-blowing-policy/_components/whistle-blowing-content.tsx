          Whistleblowing Policy
        </h1>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
          Introduction and Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          Covenant Microfinance Bank Ltd. (CMFB) is committed to the highest
          standards of accountability and transparency. To reinforce this
          commitment, CMFB has established a Whistleblowing Policy as a critical
          component of its fraud risk management framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy is aligned with best practices and guidelines from the
          Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Financial Reporting Council of
          Nigeria (FRCN). It enables employees and external stakeholders —
          including customers, suppliers, consultants, and partners — to report
          unethical, illegal, or improper conduct without fear of retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The policy applies to all employees of CMFB, regardless of position,
          location, or function, as well as to third parties who interact with
          the Bank.
        </p>

          Whistleblowing Procedures
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Whistle-blowers can report concerns through several dedicated
          channels, which can be done confidentially or anonymously. The
          procedure involves these steps:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Reporting Channels:</strong> A whistle-blower can submit a
            formal letter to the MD/CEO, Head of Internal Audit, Chief
            Compliance Officer, or Head of HR/Admin. Concerns can also be
            reported via dedicated hotlines or the bank's official email and
            website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reporting Format:</strong> The report should include the
            background and history of the concern with relevant dates, reasons
            for the concern, and any supporting evidence to aid the
            investigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Whistle-blowers are expected to
            act in good faith and provide verifiable facts, not mere speculation
            or rumors. They should also provide further evidence to assist in
            the investigation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
          Protection of the Whistleblower
        </h2>
        <p>
          The policy is formulated to protect whistle-blowers who disclose
          information in good faith and with the reasonable belief that a
          malpractice or irregularity has occurred. The Bank will treat all
          disclosures confidentially, and the identity of the whistle-blower
          will be kept confidential. The policy strictly prohibits any form of
          retaliation against a staff member for reporting an irregularity.
          Penalties, including disciplinary measures, will be taken against any
          staff who takes retaliatory action.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
          Policy Updates and Review
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for keeping the Board
          informed about whistle-blowing updates. The policy is subject to
          review every three years or as needed based on changes in the
          regulatory environment or best practices. All suggested amendments
          must be sent to the Chief Compliance Officer, and the Board has the
          authority to approve these updates.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">
          <strong>
            The current version of the policy, approved in 2024, is version 1.0.
